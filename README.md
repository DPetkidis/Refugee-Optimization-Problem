# Refugee-Optimization-Problem
<div style="text-align: justify">
This project tackles the problems faced by both refugees and the government in Greece. It optimises the transfer of the refugees from the overcrowded island hotspots to mainland camps via marine and land routes. At the same time, the possibility of building new camps with different sizes to accommodate more refugees is being examined and the supply provision is optimized to both existing and potentially new camps. All this takes place with respect to a certain budget. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate different scenarios based on various budgets. 
<br /> The project was part of a scientific poster presentation for the University of Edinburgh.
